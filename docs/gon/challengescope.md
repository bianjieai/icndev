<br/>

## Timeline

<br/>

The incentivized testing phase has 3 stages with different tasks. Tasks will be revealed gradually as the game progresses.

<br/>

Participants can refer to the [installation doc](https://github.com/game-of-nfts/gon-testnets/blob/main/doc/installation.md) to install the client software and the [instruction doc](https://github.com/game-of-nfts/gon-testnets/blob/main/doc/instruction-ics721.md) to get familiar with Interchain NFTs Transfer operations.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

### Stage 1: Welcome to GoN

<br/>

**Started from Mar 1**
* Create Collections and NFTs
* Perform Interchain NFTs Transfer

<br/>

#### Round 1: Warm-ups
IRISnet, Stargaze, Juno, Uptick and OmniFlix have prepared their testnets, allowing participants to create their collections and NFTs. These NFTs can be used for the next transfer tasks of the game, marking the first time participants can experience Interchain NFT Transfer.

<br/>

**Rules:**
* Participant issue their own classes and must set class data as the JSON string below
* This allows participants to bind their classes(collections, denoms) to their GitHub account and prove that they have control over the class owner
* All the following tasks related to NFT transfer must be minted under their classes
* Class owner must be the IRISnet address of the participant at the time of registration
```
{
  "github_username": "username, this is a must",
  "discord_handle": "discord handle, this is optional",
  "team_name": "your team name, this is optional",
  "community": "if you come from a community"
}
```
<br/>

**Tasks:**
A1,A2,A3,A4,A5,A6

<br/>

### Stage 2: Let's Dive into Interchain NFTs Transfer

<br/>

**Started from Mar 6**
* Perform Interchain NFT Transfer through different flows

<br/>

#### Round 2: Journey for One
Participants complete Interchain NFTs Transfer independently, which means they need to perform operations using their own account addresses on each chain. For each task, participants should start transferring with a different NFT. As a result, they need to create multiple NFTs under their collections.

<br/>

**Rules:**
* Each NFT can only be used as evidence once for tasks in Round 2.
* Participants must use NFT minted under classes/denoms they issued in Round 1.
* Participants must use their own account addresses provided at the registration stage.
* Flow can be queried off-chain with flow-id.

<br/>

**Tasks:**
A7~A20

<br/>

### Stage 3: Enjoy the Carnival of GoN

<br/>

**Started from Mar 13**
* Competitive individual race
* Quiz game
* ‚Ä¶

<br/>

#### Round 3: Competitive Individual Race
Participants receive NFT airdrops on IRISnet and perform Interchain NFT Transfer through specified flows in Task Data. The airdrop has two rounds: In the first round, all participants go through the same flow, and in the second round, all participants go through different flows.

<br/>

The first round airdrop will start at around 2023-03-15-06:00 UTC, and the second round airdrop will start at around 2023-03-16-06:00 UTC. Before that, participants can prepare their strategies. Please make sure that you have been added to the `gon-evidence` repository and your information is correct, otherwise, you may not receive the airdrop!

<br/>

**Task Data:**
```
{
  "type": "individual race round",
  "flow": "the flow id, check flow with flow-id on https://github.com/game-of-nfts/gon-testnets/blob/main/doc/flow-table.md",
  "last_owner": "the ultimate owner of this NFT",
  "start_height": "transfer before this height are considered invalid"
}
```

<br/>

**Rules:**
* The `flow` can be queryied with `flow-id` [here](https://github.com/game-of-nfts/gon-testnets/blob/main/doc/flow-table.md).
* The `start_height` is the block height on IRISnet. Any transfer prior to the `start_height` will be considered invalid.
* Participants must use their own account addresses provided at the registration stage.
* The `last_owner` is an official address on IRISnet. After finishing the interchain NFT transfer, every participant transfer the NFT to `last_owner` then complete the race.
* Considering the time zone difference, the completion time is calculated by the difference in height between the last NFT transfer (to the `last_owner`) and the first interchain NFT transfer on IRISnet.
* The participant with the smallest difference in block height will rank higher, and in case of a tie, the ranking will be based on the height of the last transfer, with the participant having the lower height ranking higher.
* The end of round 3 will be at `2023-03-17-23:59:59 UTC`. The height of evidence will be considered invalid if completed after the corresponding block height.

<br/>

**Tasks:**
B1, B2, B3, B4

<br/>

#### Round 4: Competitive Team Race
Round 4 follows a procedure similar to that of Round 3, with the exception of a different ranking method. Participants will receive three rounds of airdrops simultaneously around `2023-03-21 06:00 UTC`, and then proceed with the Interchain NFT Transfer according to the flow in the `Task Data`. For the final interchain transfer, they must first transfer the NFT back to their Iris addresses and then transfer it to the `last_owner`. In this round, the ranking is calculated by summing the differences in block heights of each NFT between the last NFT transfer and the first Interchain NFT transfer on IRISnet. If two participants have the same sum, the participant with the lower sum of the first transfer height of each NFT will rank higher. Therefore, if participants have team members, they can transfer the three NFTs in parallel to get higher rank. **Note that you must complete all of B5, B6 and B7 in order to be eligible for ranking.**

<br/>

**Task Data:**
```
{
  "type": "team race round",
  "flow": "the flow id, check flow with flow-id on https://github.com/game-of-nfts/gon-testnets/blob/main/doc/flow-table.md",
  "last_owner": "the ultimate owner of this NFT",
  "start_height": "transfer before this height are considered invalid"
}
```

<br/>

**Rules:**
* The `start_height` is the block height on IRISnet. Any transfer prior to the `start_height` will be considered invalid, which means your first Interchain NFT Transfer must happen after that height. Note that `start_height` is not used for calculate your grade.
* The `last_owner` is an official address on IRISnet, and is the final recipient of the NFT in this game.
* Considering the time zone difference, the completion time is calculated by the **difference** in height between the last NFT transfer (to the `last_owner`) and the first Interchain NFT transfer (not `start_height`) on IRISnet.
* Participants must use their own account addresses provided at the registration stage.
* Participants must complete all of B5, B6 and B7 in order to be eligible for the ranking, which is calculated by summing the differences in block heights of each NFT between the last NFT transfer and the first Interchain NFT transfer on IRISnet.
* The fourth round of the competition will conclude at `2023-03-24 23:59:59 UTC`. After this, you can still complete B5, B6 and B7, but your race rank will not be counted, and you will not be eligible to win B8.
* The top 10 participants in each airdrop round will be awarded B8 points. Evidence is not required for B8.

<br>

**Tasks:**
B5, B6, B7, B8

<br/>

#### Round 5: Quiz Game
In the quiz game, the organizers will airdrop 100 Quiz NFTs that are owned by 100 preset addresses around `2023-03-21 08:00 UTC`. Participants are required to **guess the answer** to the question in `Task Data`, which serves as the secret key to decrypt the mnemonics. The participants must then use the mnemonics to generate these preset addresses and transfer the NFT according to the flow.

<br/>

The quiz questions cover different domains which are related to Cosmos and NFT. All answers are single words containing lowercase characters, hyphens, and Arabic numerals.

<br/>

**Task Data:**
```
{
	"question": "the answer of this question is the key to decrpyt the mnemonics",
	"mnemonics_encrypted": "aes encrypted mnemonics",
	"flow": "the flow id, check the flow off-chain"
}
```

<br/>

**Rules**
* The answer is a single word of lowercase characters, hyphens and numbers. The possible format are `abc`, `abc-10`, `10-abc`, `10abc`, `abc10` and `1234`.
* To ensure fairness, any DMs to the coordinators regarding quiz game will not be responded to.
* A uniform encryption and decryption tool is provided to ensure that the answers can be correctly decrypted.
* The total number of NFTs is only 100, and each player can solve as many questions as possible to get points.
* The final owner of the NFT must be participants‚Äô own addresses on IRISnet. Otherwise, they won‚Äôt get points.

<br/>

**Tools:**

<br/>

We provide a tool for decrypting the enrpyted menenocis with the answer of each question. Note that go is a prerequsite for this tool.
```
git clone https://github.com/game-of-nfts/gon-toolbox

cd gon-toolbox

make install

gontool aes decrypt [answer] [encrypted_mnemonics]
```

<br/>

**Tasks:**
B9

<br/>

### Challenge
During the activity on the testnet, we found that there were some issues when transferring through the designated channels, possibly caused by defects or attacks. A large number of transactions needed to wait a long time to be smoothly relayed, which has become a recognized challenge.

<br/>

However, this is also the meaning of the existence of the testnet. By solving these exposed issues, we can operate better in the formal environment. Therefore, we have set up challenge tasks to encourage participants to solve these problems, ensure the stability and normal operation of the channels, and obtain challenge points.

<br/>

Open an issue on `gon-evidence` to show you can solve the challenge!

<br/>

#### C1: Strategy of relaying your tx smoothly
Provide the most effective strategy and tool for transferring a stuck transaction package to the destination chain, ensuring seamless transaction relay between different blockchains.

<br/>

**Rules:**
* Select only two best solutions
* Explain the principle and provide the code

<br/>

#### C2: Strategy of preventing bunch txs stuck on channels
Provide the most effective strategy to ensure smooth and uncongested transfer operation between chains, preventing batches of transactions from getting stuck.

<br/>

**Rules:**
* Select only one best solution
* Explain the principle and provide the code

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Point System
